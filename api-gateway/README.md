This is the API Gateway for the ChainOptim microservices. It uses Spring Cloud for routing and load balancing requests to the appropriate services, Kubernetes for service discovery, Redis for rate limiting, Resilience4J for circuit breaking and more. To build it, go to scripts and run `./BuildImage.ps1` or `./BuildImage.sh`. Then add it to your Minikube cluster or restart it with `kubectl rollout restart deployment chainoptim-apigateway`.
