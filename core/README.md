This is the core microservice of the ChainOptim backend. It is responsible for tenant management, Goods and Production modules (soon to be split into separate services), security, third-party integrations and more. It is the remainder of the former monolith in [this repo](https://github.com/TudorOrban/ChainOptim-backend). To build it, go to scripts and run `./BuildImage.ps1` or `./BuildImage.sh`. Then add it to your Minikube cluster or restart it with `kubectl rollout restart deployment chainoptim-core`.
